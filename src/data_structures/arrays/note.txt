- abstraction: is an important aspect of software engineering
    + HOW am operation is performed inside a class
    + WHAT's visible class user
    + make it easier to design a program because we don't need to think about implementation details at too early a stage
      in the design process

- Arrays in Java are objects (use new to create arrays)
    + When we insert an item into this array, the correct location must be found for the insertion: just above a smaller
        value and just below a larger one. Then all the larger values must be moved up to make room
    + Order arrays decision speeds up searching somewhat but slows down insertion
- advantage ordered arrays
