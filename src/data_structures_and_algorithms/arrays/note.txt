- Arrays in Java are objects (use new to create arrays)
    + When we insert an item into this array, the correct location must be found for the insertion: just above a smaller
        value and just below a larger one. Then all the larger values must be moved up to make room
    + Order arrays decision speeds up searching somewhat but slows down insertion
- Ordered arrays
    + The major advantages is that search times are much faster than is an unordered arrays
    + The disadvantage is that insertion takes longer because all the data items sorted
    + Deletions are slow in both ordered and unordered arrays because items must be moved
- Logarithms: Notice the differences between binary search times and linear search times. Searching 10 items would take
    an average of five comparisons with a linear search (N/2) and a maximum of four
    comparisons with a binary search. But the more items there are, the bigger the difference. With 100 items...
    We can conclude that for all but very small arrays, unsorted arrays, target element is near the beginning,
    the binary search is greatly superior.

- Binary Search (Log2(n))
